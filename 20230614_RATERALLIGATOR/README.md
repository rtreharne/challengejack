# 20230614_RATERALLIGATOR

We've been talking about this project for ages! We want to build a simple \\
web application that allows users to rate something (e.g. lecture/seminar etc).

Your task Jack (should you choose to accept it) is to create a new GitHub repo \\
called `rateralligator` and prepare a Django project that we can start developing.

Your mission objectives for this challenge are as follows:

1.  Create a public repo using your own GitHub account
    + Tick the "Add a README file" box.
    + Add a .gitignore (use the Python template)
    + Choose a license - I recommend the GNU General Public License v3.0
    + [Watch this video!](https://youtu.be/UK52v6bCPvg)

2.  Clone the repo to your local computer. Use SSH!
    + Open up VS Code, open a terminal and navigate to somewhere sensible (or create a new directory).
    + Clone your repo: e.g. `git clone git@github.com: jfoster/rateralligator.git`
    + [Configuring SSH for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

3. Create a Virtual Environment using Venv
    + [How to Set Up a Virtual Environment in Python - And Why It's Useful](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
    + Activate the Venv and install Django: `pip install django`
    + Create a requirements.txt file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

4.  Create a new Django Project
    + [Writing your first Django app, part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/)
    + Create an app called `main`.

5. Commit and push to your GitHub

6. Update this README.md with the url to your repo below
    + <REPO URL HERE!>
    + Commit your changes to this file and make a pull request to Rob.
